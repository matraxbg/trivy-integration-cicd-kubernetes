This is a repository that contain example materials for a presentation for dev.bg.
It basically shows some examples of two images (one with critical vulnerability and one not), how they can be scanned with trivy and outputted to an HTML report. 

Also there is an example on how to deploy trivy-operator to Kubernetes and how to view some of the CRDs, created by it.
